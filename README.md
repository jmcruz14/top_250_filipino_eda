# Top 250 Filipino Movies on Letterboxd â€“ Analysis
*Jupyter notebook analysis of the Top 250 Filipino Movies on Letterboxd. Data was exhaustively analyzed with the help of existing repos*
*built to scrape the website's information directly (or indirectly). The code responsible for this is primarily sourced from a fork of*
*L-Dot's Letterboxd List Scraper.*

You can access the notebook [here](https://github.com/jmcruz14/letterboxd_list_scraper/blob/master/Letterboxd%20Top%20250%20Filipino%20EDA.ipynb).

### Future Plans
- Additional analysis of the Top 250 in terms of Crew (Editor, Cinematographer, etc.) frequency
- Develop a Dash App which allows easy analysis of provided dataset
- Improve and refactor webscraping to extract additional metadata (Progress on L-Dot's fork can be found [here](https://github.com/jmcruz14/Letterboxd-list-scraper-V2?organization=jmcruz14&organization=jmcruz14).)
